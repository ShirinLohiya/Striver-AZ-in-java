# 🧠 Striver DSA Sheet - Java Solutions

Hey there! 👋  
This repository is where I’m **tracking my progress** as I solve problems from the **Striver DSA Sheet** using **Java**. 🧑‍💻🔥

## 📌 What is the Striver Sheet?

The [Striver DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) is a curated list of **must-solve DSA problems** designed by [Raj Vikramaditya (Striver)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajvikramaditya/). It's widely used by students and aspiring software developers to **build strong foundations in Data Structures and Algorithms**, especially for cracking tech interviews.
